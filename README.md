# Colorado Department of Wildlife big game hunt statistics (colorado-dow)
## Project Description - Why did I choose it?
I've personally spent countless hours pouring over hunt tables to decide where/when to hunt. Some analytical visual representations would certainly provide a more valuable solution. These will also lead to more questions about historical results.

This project has many variables that determine differing outcomes.

There are influences from multiple environments (supply/demand/regulations/weather)

This project also has an intuitive progression of the Analytics Roadmap

I started this back in 2015 which culminated into a Web-app example
https://dowproject.shinyapps.io/GJSON/

This year I'd like to walk through the analytics roadmap and detail the nuances of each phase.  The increase in value and difficulty as we progress through the phases should be pretty apparent.

## Phase I -- Descriptive Analytics (What happened)
I would like to hunt next year and would like to know which season will provide me the best chance of success for a certain Unit.  How did things go in past years?

I would like to hunt next year in a certain season, but am open to which Unit to hunt in. Which one will provide me the best opportunity of success? How did things go in past years?

## Phase II -- Diagnostic Analytics (Why did it happen)
Any relationship between Units and their results?
Are there other factors to consider?
* Preference Points
* Herd size
* Weather

## Phase III -- Predictive Analytics (What will happen)
* Preprocessing and data transformations
* Model building / tuning / training
* Model testing

## Phase IV -- Prescriptive Analytics (How can we make it happen)
What can we influence? This is probably something DOW performs for future yearâ€™s regulations.
