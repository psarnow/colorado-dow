# Colorado Department of Wildlife big game hunt statistics (colorado-dow)

Personal experience of pouring over hunt tables for many hours to decide where/when to hunt
Lots of variables that determine differing outcomes
Influences from multiple environments (supply/demand/regulations/weather)
Intuitive progression of Analytics Roadmap

## Phase I -- Descriptive Analytics (What happened)
I would like to hunt next year and would like to know which season will provide me the best chance of success for a certain Unit.  How did things go in past years?
I would like to hunt next year in a certain season, but am open to which Unit to hunt in. Which one will provide me the best opportunity of success? How did things go in past years?

## Phase II -- Diagnostic Analytics (Why did it happen)
Any relationship between Units and their results?
Are there other factors to consider?
* Preference Points
* Herd size
* Weather

## Phase III -- Predictive Analytics (What will happen)
* Preprocessing and data transformations
* Model building / tuning / training
* Model testing

## Phase IV -- Prescriptive Analytics (How can we make it happen)
What can we influence? This is probably something DOW performs for future yearâ€™s regulations.
